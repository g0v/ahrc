Taiwan Goverment</h2><p>Mr. Chiou Ho-shun, accused of being the head of a 12-member criminal gang responsible for murdering and dismembering a female in Nov. 1987, and for kidnapping a 10-year-old boy in Dec. 1987, was first sentenced to death in Nov. 1989. Mr. Chiou and the other 11 so-called “criminal gang” members were co-defendants in his case’s criminal procedure. After 22 years of repeated appeal hearings, his death sentence was finalized in 2011. According to the application Mr. Chiou submitted to the Court, Mr. Chiou claims that his conviction was based on confessions made by Mr. Chiou and other co-defendants, part of which was proved to have been extracted by torture and coercion by prosecutors and police officers who have since been convicted of using torture during the initial investigation in 1994. He further claims that there was no material evidence in the two cases indicating that all 12 defendants were involved in the case. Mr. Chiou has been imprisoned for the past 30 years since he was arrested in Sep. 1988.</p></div><a href="https://github.com/g0v/ahrc" target="_blank">Github</a></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"dataManager":"[]","props":{"pageProps":{"content":"## About\n\nThe Asian Human Rights Court Simulation (AHRCS) was founded on 8 October 2018, through the collaborative efforts of Asian civil society members, who have aspired to build a human rights court of the peoples, by the peoples, and for the peoples via our own initiatives, to ensure that human rights principles and values are safeguarded through transparent legal proceedings.\n\n## FAQ\n\n* why are we doing it?\n\nQ:Asia is the sole continent without a regional human rights court.
